Hello! Welcome to my Halloween Cat AI: V-1.0.0
https://www.google.com/search?q=halloween+cat+game  then click play, then run the code
If you want it to work, make sure zoom is 100%
Make sure halloween cat is in the first monitor/main screen and the cmd line doesn't block the screenshot (it uses the main menu to locate it)
Make sure it is at its max size, shrinking the window horizontally doesn't also shrink the game vertically
HOLD DOWN Q TO SHUT IT OFF. You may need to for a second but it will shut off.
