# Halloween Cat AI: V-1.0.0
Hello! Welcome to my Halloween Cat AI: V-1.0.0
This was my third iteration in the google game AI's and by far the best. 

# How to Run it
Go to this [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=halloween+cat+game) then click play, and run the code
If it's not working, here's how you might be able to fix the issue:
1. Make sure zoom is 100%
2. Make sure halloween cat is in the first monitor/main screen and the cmd line (or anything else) doesn't block the screenshot. It uses the main menu to locate the game
3. Make sure it is at its max size, shrinking the window horizontally or shrinking the game vertically may cause issues. Also, a really small monitor might have similar issues
**HOLD DOWN Q TO SHUT IT OFF**. You may need to hold it down for a second or so but it will shut off.
